# GitHub Pages Setup

- [x] Start with a simple repo + single page.
- [x] Try generating some diagrams.
- [x] Try using a Jekyll style.
  - It seems weird that simply dropping a config file into place (as recommended by GitHub Copilot) would work.
    - Jekyll appears to require some logic (Ruby) to run, which exists nowhere (yet) in this repo of static docs.
- [ ] Try GitHub desktop.
