# GitHub Pages Setup

- [x] Start with a simple repo + single page.
- [x] Try generating some diagrams.
- [x] Try using a Jekyll style:
  - It seems weird that simply dropping a config file into place would work, as recommended by GitHub Copilot:

    - [GPT-4.1 steps 3-5](2025-06-30/GPT-4.1_steps_3_to_5.png)
  - Jekyll appears to require some logic (Ruby) to run, which exists nowhere (yet) in this repo of static docs.
  - But the [rendered pages](https://wolfen.github.io/) _are_ affected by the Jekyll config, as explained here:
    - [GPT-4.1 explanation steps 1-3](GPT-4.1_question_1_3.png)
    - [GPT-4.1 explanation step 4 and answer]GPT_4.1_question_4_A.png)
  - Still, I removed the `_config.yml` file because the rendered pages look awful.
- [ ] Try GitHub desktop.
